Sure! Here is the code for a Telegram bot in C# that reacts to the `/start` command, sends a greeting, displays buttons, and allows for further interaction:

Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your bot token.

In this example, when a user sends the /start command, the bot sends a welcome message with buttons "Button 1" and "Button 2". When the user clicks a button, the bot sends a corresponding message in response.
